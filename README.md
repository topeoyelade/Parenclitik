# Parenclitik
This contains MATLAB scripts for analysing data using parenclitic network approach developed first by Zanin et al 2014
The code is a set of steps and contains various functions which: 
1. Extract data from any sort of file (csv, xlsx etx)
2. compute the peranclitic deviations 
3. compute parencltic network of individual patients usig their parenclitic deviation values as weights of netwrok edges
4. compute the network topology indices of the pranclitic network of individual patients
5. Outputs complete result including appropriate heading/labels of variables
